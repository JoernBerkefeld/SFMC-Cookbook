# SFMC-Cookbook

This is an attempt at starting a guide on how to survive as a developer for Salesforce Marketing Cloud.

## Content

- [x] [General FAQ](faq/README.md)
- [x] [General coding guideline](general/README.md)
- [x] [HowTo deal with Server-Side JavaScript / SSJS](ssjs/README.md)
- [x] [HowTo deal with AMPscript](ampscript/README.md)
- [x] [Einstein Recommendations](einstein/recommendation/README.md)

The guides are by no means finished and are to be considered work in progress. I will add more rules & advice over time.

## Notes

### Thanks

Kudos goes to [John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa) and his [Angular Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) for inspiring me to write this.
